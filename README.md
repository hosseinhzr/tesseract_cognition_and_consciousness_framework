### On Discovery of Nature's Idea and The Evolution of knowledge

Knowledge is not a property; it is an evolving cunstuct, shaped by those who seek to understand it.
This work of idea and its theories are not to be owned, but expanded, challenged, and refined.
Yet, every theory has an origin. And every framework must be credited to those who first articulated its principles.

## Core Idea

The Tesseract Cognition & Consciousness Framework (TCCF) proposes cognition, consiousness and decision making as a non-linear and hyperdimentional structure. People usually believe the mind moves like a clock, first past, then present, then future.

But maybe it doesn‚Äôt.

Most theories say memory, intelligence, and awareness are like a timeline. One thing happens, then another, then another. But what if the mind doesn‚Äôt follow that rule?

What we call "now" might not be a fixed thing at all. The way we remember, decide, or experience time might not even be happening in one direction. Maybe it jumps, loops, or connects in ways we do not fully see.
So with that said instead of treating intelligence, memory and consiousness as a sequentiall process from past to present events, TCCF suggests:

- Consiousness is a hyperdimentional process; meaning that it is not just an emeregent product of the brain but structured within a self-referencing time-embedded structured lattice.
- Memory is non-linear; meaning that the information is stored in a 4D cognitive structure, where we see that past states are actually probabilistically accessible instead of strictly sequential - will be elaborated in depth on Section 2. The 4D Memory Model
- Desision making is entangled with past states and will stay in supperposition until observed; proposing Cognition functions as a recrusive, iterative system rather than a simple cause-and-effect chain - will be discussed furher in Chapter 3. Quantum Cognitive Reasoning (QCR)

Maybe choices do not come in order. Maybe they float between possible outcomes for a while, waiting. Only when we look at them, one becomes real. The others? They just... stay there. Never seen, never chosen.

### 1. The Tesseract of Consciousness Model (TCM) we will

- be elaborating on Time-based cognition, hyperdimensional memory and decision making structures.
- Propose that Consiousness itself my be structured like a tesseract, allowing for non-linear awareness of time and decisions.

## 2. The four dimentional (4D) Memory Model

We traditionaly think of memory as a stored data like a recording on a storage or a timeline of past moments saved in the brain, just waiting to be played again

But what if this idea is wrong?

The proposed 4D Memory Model is actually a foundational component of TCM that proposes memory is no a linear sequence, but a hyperdimensional structure.

TCCF suggests that the brain does not "store" the past like a file. Instead, it rebuilds it, every single time.

- A foundational component of TCM that proposes memory is no a linear sequence, but a hyperdimensional structure.

So instead of "retrieving" a memory, the brain pulls together bits and pieces; some from experience, some from expectations, some from things that make sense right now.

- **Memory does not sit still.** It moves, depending on **where we are, how we feel, what is important at this moment**.
- **What we remember is not just "what happened."** It is **filtered through what we know now, what we feel now, what matters now**.
- **The past is not frozen.** Every time we remember something, **we change it, even without knowing**.

- Memory retrieval is probabilistic, not strictly historical; meaning that past states are referenced dynamically based on contextual entanglement, meaning that memory recall is not a purely sequention rather shaped by relevance, emotional weight and associative connections - aka, it's Experience in the specific Location at an exact time that determines what gets recalled.
- It‚Äôs not just about what happened, but in which exact location (aka coordinates) you were in that specific time, how you felt, and the exact moment in time; memory isn‚Äôt stored like a timeline, it‚Äôs locked into experience itself; it is the 4 Dimentional storage of the information

## 3. Quantum Cognitive Reasoning (QCR)

What if reasoning is not fixed, not just a sequence of steps? What if choices exist in multiple states at once, shaped by past experiences but not truly "real" until acted upon?

QCR says reasoning does not work like a flowchart. It does not just move from A to B to C in a fixed way. Instead, it adapts, loops back, shifts, and corrects itself as new thoughts or experiences come in.

Instead of fixed decision paths, QCR says choices exist in a fluid, constantly evolving state just like human thought.

QCR fits inside TCCF and the 4D Memory Model, which means reasoning does not simply react to new information. Instead, it reshapes itself based on what came before, what is happening now, and what might happen next.

### A word from the author

This is not just a theory. It is a way to look at intelligence, time, and thought in a different way. A model that might explain something bigger than we realize.

Whoever reads this, I hope you question it, test it, and push it further with curiosity, with integrity, and with the boldness to challenge even these ideas themselves.
Ideas are not meant to sit still. They are meant to be challenged.
